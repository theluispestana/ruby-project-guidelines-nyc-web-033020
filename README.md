# Flatiron Mod 1 Project - Music Application

Description:
    This application allows a user to search for a music artist from the musixmatch API. The user can then get more information about the artist, view the artist’s last 3 releases, favorite the artist, and see everyone who favorited the artist. Furthermore a user can create and update their own rating for an artist and see all of their favorite artists.

Install Instructions: 
    This application can be forked and cloned from Github to your local machine. You will also need an API key from musixmatch (https://developer.musixmatch.com/). Once you have your API key from musixmatch you will need to install the ruby gem dotenv. Instructions for setting up dotenv can be found here: (https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv). Make sure to run bundle install in your terminal after adding dotenv.

    Once dotenv is installed, follow the above instructions on how to create a .env file and add a variable named api_key within the file. Make sure to add your .env file to your .gitignore file. Once this is all set up you will be able to run the program by entering the command ruby bin.run.rb into your terminal while at the root of the application folder.
